          Shalom Hospital was established as a clinic in 1984 in a rented house
          in Mutituni. It grew in stages, changed location and in 1992 was
          upgraded to Dr. Onyangoâ€™s Maternity & Nursing Home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Undaunted and unfazed by the obstacles faced, Shalom Hospital Machakos
          opened its doors in 1998 to become a fully-fledged private hospital
          with an aim to providing quality and affordable healthcare in the
          region. This growth led to the birth of Athi River Shalom Community
          Hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shalom Hospitals was the forerunner of integrated healthcare in Kenya
          through accreditation by the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF)
          making it a pioneer among the private hospital to be accredited as
          NHIF comprehensive. Today, the group's futuristic vision has ensured
          that it has been in a position of strength at every touch point of the
          healthcare delivery chain. Its presence encompasses over 500 beds
          across 4 hospitals, 2 primary care & diagnostic clinics in Machakos,
          Kajiado and Kisumu counties.
